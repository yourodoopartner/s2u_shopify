            <p>Our module is a connector between Shopify and Odoo 13. You are able to map products between Odoo and shopify. Product mutations in Odoo and/or Shopify wil not be synchronized to a mapped product, this to avoid not to break things done by the webdesigners.</p>
            <p>The module is working with the shopify webhooks (JSON format), see the main controller for the endpoints.</p>
            <p>On Odoo product level it is possible to use the Odoo inventory and push the inventory for the specified product to Shopify.</p>
			<p>Per country you define the fiscal position for using the correct vat.<p>
			<p>We give no free support on this module, if you need assistance/support you can contact us.<p>
